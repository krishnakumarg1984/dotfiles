find /path -name '*.pdf' -exec sh -c 'pdftotext "{}" - | grep --with-filename --label="{}" --color "your pattern"' \;
pdfgrep -HiR 'a pattern to search recursively from path' /some/path

H: Print the file name for each match.
i: Ignore case distinctions.
R: Search directories recursively.
recoll -t -q dir:pwd ext:pdf 'neuro*'
find /path -iname '*.pdf' -exec pdfgrep pattern {} +

There's a Haskell program called pdf2line which works well.

ebook-convert file.pdf file.txt
it can convert PDF to plain text, or other ebook-format (RTF, ePub), in my
opinion it generates better results than pdftotext, although it is
considerably slower.

abiword --to=txt file.pdf

Recoll is great stuff as well
